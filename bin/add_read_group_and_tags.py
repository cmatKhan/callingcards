This script takes as input a bam file which has a barcode, probably added by
UMITools, of length n added to the end of each QNAME. The barcode is extracted
based on length (eg, if the barcode is 13 characters, then 13 characters are
extracted from the end of the QNAME string of each read). Currently, this
script loops over the bam file twice -- the first time, extracting the barcode
from each read, during which a unique set of barcodes are created. Then, a
write-able bamfile is opened, this unique set of barcodes is added as a RG
(read group) header, which makes parsing, eg splitting the bam into parts by
RG possible. Then, a second loop is performed during which the tags RG, XZ and
XI are added to each read line. RG is the read group (barcode), XZ is the
coordinate at which the transposon inserted on a given chromosome, and XI is the
sequence x bases upstream of the insertion site. If the read is unmapped,
XI and XZ are set to "*".
