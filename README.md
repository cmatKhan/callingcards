## DEVELOPMENT NOTES

__CURRENTLY THE WORKING BRANCH IS MAMMALS_PIPELINE__

### DEVELOPMENT INSTALLATION

You will need the following two pieces of software to run this pipeline:

1. [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
2. One of: [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (singularity or docker are far preferred)

AND, you will need to download [git lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) in order to
fully clone this repository. This is not a good way of doing the test data, but
until I curtail the chr1 fasta file, it is how I am doing it.
If you are on a linux system, do this:

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install git-lfs
$ git lfs install
```
If you're using mac, then you can probably substitute `apt` for `brew`. If you're
using Windows, you should think about the life choices that have brought you to
this point, and then partition your hard drive and install ubuntu. Or, google
about and then let me know what works, and I'll update the readme.

Alternatively, email me, and I'll send you a a zipped version of the repo.

Note: it isn't necessary to make the cc_tester directory -- call it whatever you
like, or do this differently. Just make sure the path in the run script below
points to the main.nf file in the callingcards repo.

Assuming you have git lfs, then clone the repo. _VERY IMPORTANT_: after cloning,
checkout the mammals_pipeline branch:

```
$ mkdir cc_tester
# you could download/install the nextflow executable in this directory
$ cd cc_tester
$ git clone https://github.com/cmatKhan/mislabels.git
$ cd callingcards
$ git checkout mammals_pipeline
$ cd ..
# at this point, you are in cc_tester
```

Next, copy and paste the script below into a file called, for example, `run_nf.sh`

```
#!/bin/bash

mkdir tmp

# CHOOSE ONE OF SINGULARITY, DOCKER OR CONDA. I have only tested singularity, but the others 
# probably work
nextflow run nf-core-callingcards/main.nf  -profile test_sge,<singularity/docker/conda> -resume

```
Note that this assumes that nextflow is either in your `$PATH`, or the executable is
in the same directory from which you are launching this script.

This will run the pipeline locally, meaning the compute resources come from
the machine from which you launch. Be careful -- don't do this from a login node
on the cluster, for example. This will work on your local computer, or an interactive
node with at least 16GB ram.

If you want to test this via scheduler submission, then here are examples of
SLURM and and SGE submission scripts:

__SLURM__ (htcf)
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

eval $(spack load --sh openjdk)
eval $(spack load --sh singularityce@3.8.0)
eval $(spack load --sh nextflow)

mkdir tmp

nextflow run callingcards/main.nf  -profile test_slurm,singularity -resume
```

__SGE__ (dsg -- the genetics cluster. Note that singularity is not available on the compute nodes)
```
#!/bin/bash

#$ -N nf_tester
#$ -cwd
#$ -o /dsgmnt/llfs_external/$USER/logs
#$ -e /dsgmnt/llfs_external/$USER/logs

root=/dsgmnt/llfs_external/cmateusiak

# activate environment
# note that in this case, I installed nextflow using conda like so:
# conda create -p /path/to/envs/dir/nextflow nextflow
source activate $root/conda_envs/nextflow

mkdir tmp

nextflow run nf-core-callingcards/main.nf  -profile test_sge,singularity -resume

```

## Introduction

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write a 1-2 sentence summary of what data the pipeline is for and what it does -->
**nf-core/callingcards** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline for processing Transposon Calling Cards sequencing data.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It uses Docker/Singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it much easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules) in order to make them available to all nf-core pipelines, and to everyone within the Nextflow community!

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add full-sized test dataset and amend the paragraph below if applicable -->
On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/callingcards/results).

## Pipeline summary

<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Check the sample sheet
2. Append barcodes to the fastq ID line with UMI Tools ([`UMI Tools`](https://umi-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
2. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
3. Align ([`bwamem2 mem`](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2https://umi-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
4. Add the barcodes as read groups to the bam, index and sort. Implemented in ([a custom script](https://github.com/BrentLab/callingcards/blob/main/bin/add_read_group.py) using [pysam](https://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html).
5. Bam QC ([`Qualimap`](http://qualimap.conesalab.org/))
6.
5. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.10.3`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run nf-core/callingcards -profile test,YOURPROFILE
    ```

    Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

    > * The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker`, `singularity`, `podman`, `shifter`, `charliecloud` and `conda` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` and are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues, then you can use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, you can use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
    > * If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    <!-- TODO nf-core: Update the example "typical command" below used to run the pipeline -->

    ```console
    nextflow run nf-core/callingcards -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> --input samplesheet.csv --genome GRCh37
    ```
